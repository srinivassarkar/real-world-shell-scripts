# üêö 80 Real-World Shell Scripts for DevOps & Linux Automation

This repository contains 80 real-world shell scripting problems with solutions. These are not toy examples‚Äîthey are practical scripts for system administration, DevOps, cloud, monitoring, backups, deployments, and more.

> ‚úÖ Perfect for SysAdmins, DevOps Engineers, SREs, and Linux Enthusiasts.

---

## üìÅ Structure

Each script is placed in a separate `.sh` file, named appropriately (e.g., `01-check-root.sh`, `23-monitor-disk.sh`, etc.).  
You can run, modify, or combine them as needed.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

```bash
# Make a script executable
chmod +x 01-check-root.sh

# Run a script
./01-check-root.sh
````

You can test these on any modern Linux distro. Most scripts are POSIX-compliant and WSL2-compatible.
